"Some people leave, and all you're left with is silence — louder than any goodbye."

"The saddest part of love is not the end, it's the memories that refuse to fade."

"You were my favorite chapter, but I had to close the book."

"I cared, I stayed, I tried — and still, I lost."

"Sometimes the heart holds on to people the mind has already let go."

"You broke me so beautifully, I forgot I was ever whole."

"It’s hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember."

"And in the end, we were just strangers with too many memories."
