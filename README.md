# Complete Python Course with Libraries

This repository contains my comprehensive Python practice and learning journey. The course covers fundamental to advanced Python concepts, along with practical implementations using popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of hands-on projects, exercises, and notes gathered from various resources. The aim is to solidify Python skills while gaining practical experience with essential libraries used in data analysis and visualization.

## Libraries Covered

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and array operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting.

## Learning Resources

I have consolidated knowledge from multiple online platforms and tutorials, ensuring a diverse and well-rounded approach to Python programming.

## Structure

- **Basics**: Python syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Intermediate**: Functions, OOP, and file handling.
- **Advanced**: Modules, error handling, and data processing.
- **Libraries**: Detailed practice with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Projects**: Mini-projects demonstrating the practical application of concepts learned.
- **Loops and Iterations**: Definite loops, loop idioms, and patterns in loops.
- **Strings in Python**: Intermediate string manipulation.
- **File Handling**: Reading files and files as sequences.
- **Python Lists**: Working with lists, strings, and lists.
- **Dictionaries and Tuples**: Common applications, looping, sorting, and comparing.
- **Regular Expressions**: Matching, extracting data, and practical applications.
- **Networking with Python**: Protocols, web scraping with `urllib`, and text processing.
- **Using Web Services**: Working with XML and JSON, and service-oriented approaches.
- **Python Objects and Classes**: Class structure, object lifecycle, and inheritance.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing data with Python and data projects (e.g., PageRank, Mailing Lists).
