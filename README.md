# LearnPythonWithMe

Welcome to **LearnPythonWithMe**! This repository is a study companion for the **Python for Everybody** course by [Dr. Charles Severance](https://www.dr-chuck.com/) (Dr. Chuck), a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information. Here, I document my learning journey, share code examples, and provide notes as I work through the course.
